Welcome to my blog. This is where I write about my various adventures in computer science, software, biology and other random things!

If you'd like, you should check out my [GitHub][tracedelange] and see if anything piques your interest.

<!-- If you want to see some of my work in action, check out my main website [DeLange Development][ddev] where you can find my portfolio and some interactive stuff.  -->

My repository for this site is located [here][repo]

This site was created using the jekyll template Cayman. The repository for this site template can be found [here][sitetemplate]
