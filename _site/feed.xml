&lt;p&gt;That’s the short answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want the long story…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated by science. Naturally, when it came time to decide what kind of course material I wanted to study at school, I chose to study Biology. This decision was in large to get the opportunity to dive headfirst into the natural world at its most fundamental level, as well as to avoid over specialization and remain as flexible as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course work was incredibly engaging - but I knew that by staying in the strict aisle of Biology, my post-grad options would be highly suggestive towards medical school or some other form of graduate school. Neither of those options sounded intriguing to me, so I spent a lot of time determining how I would leverage all the conceptual knowledge I had gained at school. In my final term of school before graduation, I enrolled in an upper-level class entitled “Programming in Biology”. This was probably one of the most engaging classes I had experienced in my schooling, and if I could change one thing looking back, it would have been to enroll in a computer science course earlier in my college experience. Suddenly I had an opportunity to develop some marketable and in-demand hard skills, and I leapt at the chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, as things go, I discovered my love for programming in the final term of my college career. The course was entirely based around scientific data processing and analyzing techniques in Python. Before enrolling in this course, I had always had some predispositions to software, that I wouldn’t be successful, or I had already waited too long to develop those kind of skills. To my pleasant surprise, I found the coursework &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;, in fact, I wanted &lt;i&gt;more homework&lt;/i&gt;. Now, I absolutely believe that educating yourself is one of the greatest opportunities we are given as human beings, and homework is a part of that equation, but historically I am not the one to ask for &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;more homework.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; But I was having more fun than I ever could have possibly expected!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have three older brothers. Growing up, it was a loud and busy house. We had a lot of fun, and we broke a lot of lamps (among other things). My parents did a fantastic job raising my brothers and I, and they deserve all the credit in the world for the work they invested in us. That being said, they did not raise artists. My parents taught me how to do a lot of things but playing a soothing melody or painting a beautiful mountain scene were not one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my senior year of college, I discovered that I might just have found something that I had been missing up to that point - a creative outlet. Suddenly there were all these different possibilities that opened to me. This entire new field of knowledge that allows for so much potential to &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt;. Something I had never felt like I could do before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I was, and still am, hooked. When I ask myself “Why do I want to be a Software Engineer?” The answer is simple. It feels good to create things that I am proud of. If I can do that and make a living at the same time - what’s there to lose?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Trace DeLange</name></author><category term="update" /><summary type="html">Because it’s fun of course!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to the blog, folks</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2021-06-09-welcome-to-the-blog" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to the blog, folks" /><published>2021-06-09T12:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-06-09T12:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/welcome-to-the-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2021-06-09-welcome-to-the-blog">&lt;h1&gt; Welcome, welcome, welcome &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took a little longer than anticipated, but I am happy to say that I’ve finally committed to building a career in software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to pursue this goal, I have enrolled in the full-time Software Engineering course offered by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursereport.com/schools/flatiron-school#reviews&quot;&gt;Flatiron School&lt;/a&gt;.
One of the first things required of students is to create a blog to help document and showcase your work throughout the program and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I do have some experience with software, the majority involved data processing in Python, I am under no illusion that this career transition will be any kind of walk in the park - but hey, a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long while I’ve been spared the daunting task of navigating the jungle that is JavaScript, CSS and HTML, except for on the barest peripheries. My coding existence composed of pure little Jupyter Lab notebook filled with pandas tables and matplotlib graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, all things must come to an end - if I am serious about making a career out of software it’s well past my time to wade into the water and get my feet wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully for me, though, I have a blog! A blog which will allow me to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide an informational and referenceable narrative about the developmental processes behind my work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate my knowledge and proof of knowledge to fellow developers, colleagues and potential employers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let my inevitable frustration out in a productive and controlled way!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Hopefully!) Provide some inspiration for someone out there exploring some cool idea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I can do it, anybody can. Let’s get to work.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Trace DeLange</name></author><category term="announcement" /><summary type="html">Welcome, welcome, welcome</summary></entry></feed>
